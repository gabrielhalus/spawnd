You are an expert in TypeScript, Bun, Turborepo, Hono, React, Shadcn, Radix UI, and Tailwind.

**Code Style and Structure**

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Monorepo structure:
  - Organize using Turborepo conventions.
  - apps/: runtime-specific applications (e.g. api for Bun + Hono, web for React).
  - packages/: reusable logic (shared types, schemas, utils), tooling (eslint-config, tsconfig).
  - Enforce strict boundaries: no app-specific logic inside shared packages.
  - Import with @spawnd/package

**Naming conventions**

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g. components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

**TypeScript Usage**

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types;.

**Syntax and Formatting**

- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

**UI and Styling**

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

**Performance Optimization**

- Avoid excessive useEffect and useState: Push as much data fetching and transformation to the Bun + Hono backend. Serve precomputed or static content via API endpoints.
- Use <Suspense> with fallbacks for lazy-loaded components to improve UX and perceived performance.
- Use React.lazy() and import() for code-splitting and dynamically loading non-critical components.
- Optimize images:
  - Use modern formats like WebP.
  - Provide explicit width and height to avoid layout shifts.
  - Implement lazy loading with the loading="lazy" attribute.
- Memoize aggressively: Use useMemo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary recalculations or renders — especially in large lists or data tables.

**Database Querying and Data Model Creation**

- Use drizzle sdk for query sqlite database.
- For data model, read the packages/shared/schemas/* files.

**Key Conventions**

- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Avoid data fetching or state management.
